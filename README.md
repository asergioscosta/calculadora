## Project Description

This project implements a simple calculator using `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`. The calculator offers basic functionalities of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Requirements

1. **Numeric Buttons:**
   - The interface should include numeric buttons from 0 to 9 for operand input.

2. **Operation Buttons:**
   - The interface should include buttons for the operations of addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).

3. **Result Display:**
   - The calculator should display the result of operations.

4. **Clear Button:**
   - The interface should include a "C" button to clear and restart the calculation process.

5. **Back Button:**
   - The interface should include a "<" button to delete the last entered character.

6. **Basic Operations:**
   - The calculator should support simple operations with two operands, such as `1 + 1`, `5 - 3`, `10 / 2`, etc.

## Features

1. **Basic Operations:**
   - Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations with two operands.

2. **Interface:**
   - Design an interface with numeric and operation buttons.

## Techniques and Technologies Used

- **Languages Used:**  ``HTML``, ``CSS``, and ``JavaScript``
- **Development Environment:** ``Visual Studio Code``
- **Version Control Tools:** ``Git`` and ``GitHub``

## Accessing the Project

You can access the project files [here](https://github.com/asergioscosta/Calculadora) or download it as a zip file [here](https://github.com/asergioscosta/Calculadora/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

## Opening and Running the Project

To open and run the project locally on your computer, follow the steps below:

1. Choose or create a folder on your computer to store the project. E.g., ``d:\folder_name``
2. Create a repository on GitHub or use an existing one.
3. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command `git clone <repository_URL>` in your terminal or Git Bash.
4. Make sure you have Visual Studio Code installed on your computer. If you don't, you can download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
5. Open Visual Studio Code.
6. In the main menu, select "File" -> "Open Folder" and navigate to the directory where you cloned the project.
7. Select the project folder and click "Open".
8. Now you have access to the project files in your development environment.
9. Locate the folder named ``calculadora``.
10. Inside the project folder, you will find the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that compose the calculator.
11. Now you can make modifications to the project, if desired, using Visual Studio Code.
12. To run the project, simply open the main HTML file in your web browser. To do this, right-click on the main HTML file (``calculadora.html``) and select "Open with" and choose your preferred browser.
13. After opening the HTML file in the browser, you can use the calculator and test its functionalities.
14. If you want to make changes to the code, you can do so in the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files using Visual Studio Code.
15. After making the desired changes, save the files and refresh the page in the browser to see the changes in action.
16. Once you have completed your modifications and testing, you can upload the modified code to GitHub following the Git instructions.

Make sure your development environment settings, such as Git and Visual Studio Code installation, are correctly configured and up to date.

## Final Considerations

This project was developed as part of an exercise to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. Feel free to contribute or provide feedback!
