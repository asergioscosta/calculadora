## Project Description

This project implements a simple calculator using `HTML`, `CSS`, and `Javascript`. The calculator offers basic functionalities such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Requirements

1. **Numeric Buttons:**
   - The interface should include numeric buttons from 0 to 9 for operand input.

2. **Operation Buttons:**
   - The interface should include buttons for addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).

3. **Result Display:**
   - The calculator should display the result of the operations.

4. **Clear Button:**
   - The interface should include a "C" button to clear and reset the calculation process.

5. **Back Button:**
   - The interface should include a "<" button to delete the last inserted character.

6. **Basic Operations:**
   - The calculator should support simple two-operand operations, such as `1 + 1`, `5 - 3`, `10 / 2`, etc.

## Features

1. **Basic Operations:**
   - Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations with two operands.

2. **Interface:**
   - Design an interface with numeric and operation buttons.

## Techniques and Technologies Used

- **Language Used:**  ``HTML``, ``CSS``, and ``JavaScript``
- **Development Environment:** ``Visual Studio Code``
